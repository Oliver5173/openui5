[OpenUI5. Build Once. Run on any device.](http://openui5.org)

What is it?
-----------
OpenUI5 allows building enterprise-ready web applications, being responsive to all devices and running web 
application on all browsers. It's based on JavaScript, uses jQuery as its foundation and follows web standards.
It eases developments with a client-side HTML5 rendering library including a rich set of controls. It supports
data binding with different data models (JSON, XML and OData).

It's free open source. OpenUI5 is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 - see LICENSE.txt

Try it!
-------
Check out our [interactive control playground](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#content/Controls/index.html)
and a number of [sample applications](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#demoapps.html).

Get it!
-------
Go to the [download page](http://openui5.org/download.html) to get the complete UI5 runtime and the UI5 SDK with the documentation, example apps and the complete runtime.

Consume [each OpenUI5 library](https://github.com/openui5?query=packaged-) individually via [bower](http://bower.io/), for example:
```sh
bower install openui5/packaged-sap.ui.core
```

Hack it!
--------
Get the sources and build UI5, please check the [documentation for the UI5 development setup](docs/developing.md). You might then want to understand how [control libraries are structured and controls are developed](docs/controllibraries.md).
Maybe you could find a bug and fix it?
